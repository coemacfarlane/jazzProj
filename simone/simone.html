        Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon) was an American singer,
        songwriter, pianist, arranger, and activist in the Civil Rights
        Movement. Her music spanned a broad range of musical styles including
        classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Waymon initially
        aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in
        her hometown of Tryon, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in
        New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis
        Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission
        despite a well-received audition. Waymon became fully convinced this
        rejection had been entirely due to racial discrimination. In 2003, just
        days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed on her an
        honorary degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a living, Eunice Waymon changed her name to "Nina Simone". The
        change related to her need to disguise herself from family members,
        having chosen to play "the devil's music" or "cocktail piano" at a
        nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would
        have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her
        career as a jazz vocalist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simone recorded more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974. She made her
        debut with the album Little Girl Blue. She had a hit in the United
        States in 1958 with "I Loves You, Porgy".
      </p>
      <p>
        Simone's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in
        particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like
        singing in her contralto voice.
